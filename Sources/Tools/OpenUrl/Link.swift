    /// Create a link by providing a destination URL and a title. The title
    /// tells the user the purpose of the link, and can be a string, a title
    /// key that produces a localized string, or a view that acts as a label.
    /// The example below creates a link to `example.com` and displays the
    /// title string as a link-styled view:
    ///
    ///     Brick.Link("View Our Terms of Service",
    ///           destination: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/TOS.html")!)
    ///
    /// When a user taps or clicks a `Link`, the default behavior depends on the
    /// contents of the URL. For example, SwiftUI opens a Universal Link in the
    /// associated app if possible, or in the user's default web browser if not.
    /// Alternatively, you can override the default behavior by setting the
    /// ``EnvironmentValues/openURL`` environment value with a custom
    /// ``OpenURLAction``:
    ///
    ///     Brick.Link("Visit Our Site", destination: URL(string: "https://www.example.com")!)
    ///         .environment(\.openURL, Brick.OpenURLAction { url in
    ///             print("Open \(url)")
    ///             return .handled
    ///         })
    ///
    /// As with other views, you can style links using standard view modifiers
    /// depending on the view type of the link's label. For example, a ``Text``
    /// label could be modified with a custom ``View/font(_:)`` or
    /// ``View/foregroundColor(_:)`` to customize the appearance of the link in
    /// your app's UI.
